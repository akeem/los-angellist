los-angellist
=============

los-angellist is a ruby based wrapper for the angellist.com rest api.
Hopefully, you will find the interface as idiomatic as possible.

**note**: At the moment, this wrapper only performs non-destructive api
operations. Methods requiring oauth authentication with be added shortly
